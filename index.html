      <h2>Pros of living in Oklahoma City</h2>

      <p>Are you planning on moving to Oklahoma? If only you had thought of it sooner! Back in 1889, during the Oklahoma Land Rush, one had the option to claim unoccupied land up to 160 acres…for free! But since it’s a bit late now, let’s focus on your options today. Oklahoma ranks 28th in terms of its population density and 20th in terms of land mass. What this means is that there’s still plenty of room for new settlers, although the Sooner state’s population has been growing steadily over the last few years. The state is nicknamed ‘Sooner’ because many people landed here sooner than the official start of the Land Rush to grab the best land. There are plenty of more fun facts and trivia, which we will discuss here in addition to the pros and cons of moving to Oklahoma.
